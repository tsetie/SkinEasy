1. Set up a pipenv environment. In linux this was done with a command like `pipenv --python 3.10` although you may need to change the python version
2. install flask `pipenv install Flask`
3. Add your Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to git
4. Setup your `static` and `templates` folder, as well as a basic server file such as `server.py` (I recommend starting by copying out of the [quick start guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application)
5. Add your "fan site" from Sesion 02 to the static files and get it up and running (you may have done this already...)
6. Add a "quiz" feature. This will ultimately have some question about your fandom and a page to check if the answer is correct -- this should be done with HTML forms and checked server-side, not using javascript. This will have a few core parts:
  * a GET request which returns a simple page with a question and a form for answering the question
  * A POST request (that gets called by the form) which checks the answer
  * A template which shows the person their answer, the correct answer, and has a picture IF the person answered correctly!
7. Don't forget to commit and push your code!
8. Don't forget to share your favorite resources with your peers on slack!

After step 3, to go into the shell:
  * pipenv shell

Once in shell, to run the site:
  * flask --app server run  OR flask --app server --debug run (this one better bc dont need to run server everytime you edit files)
