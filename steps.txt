1. Set up a pipenv environment. In linux this was done with a command like `pipenv --python 3.10` although you may need to change the python version
2. install flask `pipenv install Flask`
3. Add your Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to git

4. Setup your `static` and `templates` folder, as well as a basic server file such as `server.py` (I recommend starting by copying out of the [quick start guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application)

5. To go into the shell:
  * pipenv shell

6.Once in shell, to run the site:
  * flask --app app --debug run
