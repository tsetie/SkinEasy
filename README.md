## Key Features

**Describe the most challenging features you implemented
(one sentence per bullet, maximum 4 bullets):**

* The Editing of the reviews was the most challenging feature. 
* The faceted search bar was pretty challenging as well 
* Allowing users to modify quiz results on the account page was also challenging 
* Creating a responsive website and visually pleasing website for the popup forms and for products and routine page. 

## Testing Notes

**Is there anything special we need to know in order to effectively test your app? (optional):**

*When submitting the quiz form and you are redirected to the prodcuts page, if an internal server error pops up, refresh the page and the products page should work normally again. This occurs because we are loading so many products at once :(
